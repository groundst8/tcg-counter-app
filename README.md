# tcg-counter-app
Smartphone app for updating counter value on TCG counter

## Ideas

### Counter operations

- +1
- -1
- double (x2)
- clear

### Preselected chained operations

This feature would allow a chain of counter operations to be specified prior to tapping the tag and all counter updates could be done in one single tap to save time. For example say a Bristly Bill, Spine Sower and Kami of Whispered Hopes are on the battlefield each with +1/+1 counters on them. The ability to double the number of counters on each creature of Bristly Bill is activated. When that happens the ability on Kami to add an additional +1/+1 counter when one or more +1/+1 counters are added is triggered. These could be chained into a single update operation where the phone could just be tapped once to the tags on each creature rather than making updates while holding the phone against the tag for each one.

### Tracking

- counter instances
- power / toughness aggregate (similar to Arena)
  - could include base power / toughness with counters, enchantments, etc.
